Improving myself at every opportunity is what I thrive for. I grew up being taught that if you hit a thousand forehands a day on the tennis court, you'll inevitably be a better version of yourself at the next tournament. I then took that same approach to skateboarding and broke my leg within the first week. Web development's a little safer than skateboarding, so it's been working out so far.";
