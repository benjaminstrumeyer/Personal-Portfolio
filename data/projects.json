        "description": "Natural Language Processing Steam Reviews is a sentiment analyzing web app created as a final project for the NLP elective at Stony Brook University. My partner and I scrape ~75,000 reviews from the Steam website along with the reviewer's boolean recommendation rating. We use a modified version of the Turney algorithm to pinpoint phrases that express sentiments and assign them positive/negative polarity values. This allows us to parse new reviews, predict if the reviewer recommends the game, and generate statistics accordingly.",
