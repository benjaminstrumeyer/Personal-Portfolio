        "description": "Natural Language Processing Steam Reviews is a sentiment analyzer web app created as a final project for the NLP elective at Stony Brook University. My partner and I scrape ~75,000 reviews from the Steam website along with the reviewer's boolean recommendation rating. We use a modified version of the Turney algorithm to pinpoint phrases that express sentiments and assign them good/bad polarity values. This allows us to predict whether or not the reviewer recommends the game and generate statistics accordingly.",
